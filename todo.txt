 * Determine active and inactive users on the server side

 * Dynamically update active and inactive users on the client side

 * Figure out a better layout for chats (ie, make the chat part scroll, not
   the rest)

 * Use Ajax to check and see whether or not a chat name is taken
 
 * Make the 'press enter to submit' functionality work in Safari
 
 * Limit public chats displayed on the front page to ones with recent
   activity (or, if there aren't enough of those, to the ones that were
   updated most recently).
